# shopIQ Expo App

Welcome to the shopIQ mobile app, built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native.

> **Note:** This project currently simulates AI features in the frontend only. The next phase is to build a fully functional AI-powered full stack application, with real AI capabilities powered by a backend (e.g., using the Groq API).


## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. **Open the app**
   - Scan the QR code with Expo Go (iOS/Android)
   - Or use an emulator/simulator


## 🌟 Project Vision

- **Current:** Frontend-only simulation of AI features for rapid prototyping and UI/UX testing.
- **Planned:** Full stack AI app with real backend intelligence (Groq API or similar), user authentication, persistent data, and production-ready deployment.
